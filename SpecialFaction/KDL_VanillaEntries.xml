    description="The Universal Nemesis has arrived into the galaxy. It will attempt to lay waste to it in order to strengthen itself and its troops.

&lt;color=#f25e1c&gt;EXTREMELY HIGH IMPACT:&lt;/color&gt; While the difficulty varies depending on the chosen settings, the Universal Nemesis typically requires a great deal of planning to deal with.
The Universal Nemesis and its troops do not mark up, but instead all gain max hull and shield for every enemy killed, permanently. With numbers and quality, they may prove difficult to stop once launched. Note that the Universal Nemesis invades alone, and is very weak at that point, making it a prime occasion to kill him."
